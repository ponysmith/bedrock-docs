<h2>Containers</h2>
<p>
{% include br-branding.html %} has a basic container system to aid in layout. There are two container types:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Full-width</strong>: Container spans the entire available width of the parent element</li>
  <li><strong>Fixed-width</strong>: Container spans the entire available width of the parent element up to a max width as defined by <code>$br_width_fixed</code></li>
</ul>
<div class="br-message br-theme-info">
Note that the examples below have an additional background color added to make them more visible. In practice, the containers have no background color.
</div>

<h3>Full-width Container</h3>
{% include sample.html content="partials/samples/container-full.html" %}
{% include sample.html content="partials/samples/container-full-padded.html" %}

<h3>Fixed-width Container</h3>
{% include sample.html content="partials/samples/container-fixed.html" %}
{% include sample.html content="partials/samples/container-fixed-padded.html" %}


<h2>Grid</h2>

<p>
{% include br-branding.html %} includes a basic grid. The grid uses twelve columns, meaning that the column widths in any row of the grid should add up to <code>12</code>. To create a grid, create a <code>.br-row</code> element and nest one or more <code>.br-col-{n}</code> elements, where <code>{n}</code> is the number of columns you want to span.
</p>

<p>
The grid system is reponsive and will collapse to a single column display when the viewport drops beneath the mobile width defined in the <code>$br_width_mobile</code> variable.
</p>

<div class="br-message br-theme-info">
Note that the examples below have an additional background color added to make them more visible. In practice, the grid has no background color.
</div>

<h3>Normal grid</h3>
{% include sample.html content="partials/samples/grid.html" %}

<h3>Padded grid</h3>
{% include sample.html content="partials/samples/grid-padded.html" %}


<h2>Messages</h2>
{% include sample.html content="partials/samples/message.html" %}


<h2>Tables</h2>
{% include sample.html content="partials/samples/table.html" %}
